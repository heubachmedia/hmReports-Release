The command *hmRep_SET NEW AREA FOCUSABLE* sets new plugin-areas to focusable or not. If you pass *0*, new opened hmReports plugin area cannot get focus. Default value is *1*.
The command works globally for all processes. You should restore the default value (1), so that future plugin-areas behave like default (focusable).

The following example sets the hmReports area on the form to "not-focusable":

```4d
hmRep_SET NEW AREA FOCUSABLE(0)
$vl_ref:=Open Form Window (...)
 ```
